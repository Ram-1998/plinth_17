In about,contact, sponsor:
1) like and follow links mess up in mobile/tablet view.
2) Footer not centered in small(mobile) view.
3) Main body content doesn't use row class, hence footer positioning problem in mobile view.

In all 4:
1) Navbar Menu link's bottom border on hovering should be above current position.
2) Register and like should minimize to side when scrolling down.

Main content of sponspor page missing. :P
